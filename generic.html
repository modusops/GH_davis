									<p>Senior product design lead of Shutterstock Editor team. Together with a team of 2 designers, our small team aimed to build a simple yet powerful design tool anyone could use
										regardless of design experience. Through strenuous usertesting and leveraging advanced technologies, we slowly grew our user base over the course of 2 years. </br>

								<p>The Skinny</p>
								<p>In Feburary of 2016, I joined the Shutterstock Editor team while it was going through a beta release. I was excited to be on the team since working on a tools product was something I had always envisioned for myself. While building the product features was the focus when I joined, 2 years in, we are now focused on monetization. </p>

									<h2>Search</h2>
									<p>The idea behind search in Editor, is that we want Editor users to have access to the millions of high content that separate us from our competition. We designed a multi-level left panel for the initial release so users could gain access to their Shutterstock assets. Because the search feature came before a framework overhaul in our roadmap, we strugled to fit everything into the old framework. Navigation between the panels were challenging. In addition, any workflow type feature related to content within the panels were severely impacted. I worked closely with the developers to get the animation right, as it would be a detail leading to better understanding of how to navigate between panels. [Update] We're working on an update for a search takeover.</p>

									<p>Download exploration and concepts</p>
									<span class="image fit"><a href="#img4"><img src="images/Editor-panel-exploration-1-download.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
									<h2>Downloading</h2>
									<p>In the previous release, downloading took users through a series of modal. This was a sub-optimal experience as modals were small without any preview functionality. In addition, the modals did not provide areas to create upsell paths. With the new design, the download flow gets a new treatment and we enable a full takeover effect for maximum viewability. </p>

								<p>Download final design</p>
								<span class="image fit"><a href="#img5"><img src="images/Editor-App-Dec-2017-download-2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p>With the redesign, we introduced a new state to the application, removing unncessary logic that slowed development of new features. The team could now create additional features by leveraging the new state.</p>

								<p>Share exploration and concepts</p>
								<span class="image fit"><a href="#img6"><img src="images/Editor-panel-exploration-1-share.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
								<p>Our share flows in Editor needed an upgrade soon after we introduced a multi-stepped user flow. The modal approach simply could not support the additional steps without feeling unintuitive. With that in mind, we resolved to thinking about how the new right panel could be better utilized for this feature.</p>

										<p>Share final design</p>
										<span class="image fit"><a href="#img7"><img src="images/Editor-App-Dec-2017-5.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
										<p>Using the right panel for the share state, we decided quickly that we should test how users would interact with it. Should it persist? What should happen when the user clicked off? How does interacting with an object on canvas affect this modeless state? We obsessively tested the design and found users treated this state as an intermediate state. Clicking off should exit the share mode. Another issue we ran into was indicating the entry and exit point. Since the panel was launched with the Share button, we needed instead a toggle button to indicate ON/OFF. Despite these challenges, we felt great shipping our design solution.</p>
