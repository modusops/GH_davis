							<h2>Project Stage: Growth | Role: Senior Product Designer | Engineers: 10 | Designers: 2</h2>
							<p>Took the Editor application through 2 rounds of UI migration, with the 2nd round inclusive of incorporating the Shutterstock Design System built in React.</br>
							Major milestones:<br>
							- Joined the team as 2nd designer and helped evolve the app from a simple image editor, to a full featured browser-based design tool. </br>
							- Integrated with Google Slides
							- Created an SDK
							- Appl user based steady rose in course of 2 years
							- Designed, prototyped, launched, QA'd over 50 features over 8 business quarters.
							</p>

							<h2>Problem Identification</h2>
							<p>Before the design work was to be done, we spent time where applicable to indentify the design problem to tackle. Helping us focus on the problem and keep the design story boxed. We developed a method to problem identify by workshopping.</p>


							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>Prior to any design work, we invested time into research stories, dedicated to competitive analysis, which included some light user interviews. This helped us evaluate when to innovate and when it was more efficient to follow existing user patterns.</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Wireframing</h2>
							<p>Wireframing became a simple, low cost tool to understand the complexity of design stories. This helped us better point designs ahead of communicating the design vision to the development team. During this process, developers have a chance to input their concerns, insights. This helped increase velocity of feature development towards release date.</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Usability</h2>
							<p>Usability tests were conducted with internal and external folks. We used Userstesting.com when we had questions needing outside fresh eyes. </p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Prototyping</h2>
							<p>We developed prototypes when microinteractions of a single app became too unweidly. this helped us find answers to questions unforseen</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Design handoff</h2>
							<p>In reality, a design handoff is never a handoff. We collaborated closely with development throughout the production process, quickly addressing any issues that arose. </p>
