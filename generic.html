							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>Shutterstock Editor was created originally to fulfill the simple need to add filters to stock photo traffic coming from Shutterstock.com The product gradually evolved to accomodate
							more sophisticated audiences such as social media managers and small business owners. Working closely with a product owner, the design team and a gropu of 8-10 developers rapidly grew
							the product over the course of 2 years. The product now sits closer to advanced design tools such as Figma, with robust object management and editing capabilities.</p>

							<h2>The Challenge</h2>
							<p>With each feature released, we questioned ourselves whether our application was getting too unwieldy for the simple user it was originally built for. We knew our audience did not associate
							themselves with an advanced user of Photoshop, but needed something that offered just enough functionality and ease of use. Continuous user research and rapid prototyping played a key part of uncovering
						  the best design solutions.</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>Prior to any design work, we invested time into research stories, dedicated to competitive analysis, which included some light user interviews. This helped us evaluate when to innovate and when it was more efficient to follow existing user patterns.</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Wireframing</h2>
							<p>Wireframing became a simple, low cost tool to understand the complexity of design stories. This helped us better point designs ahead of communicating the design vision to the development team. During this process, developers have a chance to input their concerns, insights. This helped increase velocity of feature development towards release date.</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Usability</h2>
							<p>Usability tests were conducted with internal and external folks. We used Userstesting.com when we had questions needing outside fresh eyes. </p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Prototyping</h2>
							<p>We developed prototypes when microinteractions of a single app became too unweidly. this helped us find answers to questions unforseen</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Design handoff</h2>
							<p>In reality, a design handoff is never a handoff. We collaborated closely with development throughout the production process, quickly addressing any issues that arose. </p>
